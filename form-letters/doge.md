United States House of Representatives/ United States Senate  
Washington, DC 20515  

Greetings Congressman/Senator ____________,  
My name is ____________, and I’m writing to you today as a constituent from (Town, State). In addition to being a concerned citizen, I am employed as a (job title, industry, etc.).  

I wish to address major concerns over the Agency that is known as DOGE. The removal of federal employees would disrupt programs serving tens of millions of Americans. Families already struggling to pay for groceries would face losing SNAP and WIC. Seniors relying on Medicare or Medicaid would have their health care put on hold or cancelled. Parents and teachers would scramble without HeadStart or federally subsidized daycare, and Title 1 funding, damaging the economy in the short term due to lack of employment, and in the future due to the decimation of early childhood education opportunities. Long term, we can expect lasting, detrimental effects on medical and scientific research as federal grants are eliminated. Where we should be world leaders in health care, education, and scientific advancement, Trump and his ilk would have America sold off for parts to cronies and oligarchs in private industry.

This destruction by a single pen stroke, or database deletion, should not be possible in America. Surely it is redundant to remind you, as a key member of the legislative branch of our government, that Congress has the “Power of the Purse.” For one single man, even an elected president, to stop the funds which Congress has already allocated, is an affront to our Constitution’s system of checks and balances. I implore you to use your power as my representative to stand up for what is important to the citizens of your district. We want to go to work, take care of our families, and enjoy good health. These latest orders and firings of federal employees are inappropriate, untenable, and illegal. You must stand up and assert your responsibility as Congressman of the United States of America.

I am providing you with some statistics on the number of constituents you are serving:

- [%] of people in your district utilizing SNAP benefits.
- [%] of people in your district on Medicaid
- [%] of people in your district on Medicare
- [%] of people in your district who are Veterans
- [%] of people in your district that are Disabled
- [%] of children in your district
- [%] of Federal Employees in your district

Sincerely,
